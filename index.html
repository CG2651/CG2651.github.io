                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Emily and I am an undergraduate student from Boise State University studying
                    Games,
                    Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology.
                </p>
                <p>I specialize in Game Development, 3D Modeling, and Digital
                    Art.</p>
                <p>I created this website to showcase all the projects I've worked on.</p>

                <h4>Galactic Pizza Party</h4>
                <h5>Solo Project</h5>
                <p>Galactic Pizza Party is a physics-based VR game, built for Meta Quest 2, where you deliver pizzas to aliens by swinging and climbing around the city like Spider-Man.</p>
                <p>The video shows an older concept where the player originally deliver packages. I will update the project soon.</p>
                <p>This was made in Unity. Alien model was made using Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop, and paint.NET.</p>

                <h4>Abattoir</h4>
                <h5>Team Project</h5>
                <p>Abattoir is a 2D side-scrolling game that uses a webcam, Victorian calling cards, and an optional
                    Victorian trivia sheet to unlock doors in a dark castle. You play as a monster hunter looking for the ultimate treasure, a mummy sarcophagus. You located it in a dark tomb filled with vampires and werewolves. There are doors that are locked and the only way to open them is to scan the coresponding card by holding it in front of your webcam. Navigate the maze, collect some treasure, and claim the sarcophagus.</p>
                <p>This project was created with 4 other
                    students, and made in Unity with Vuforia for AR Image Tracking. My contributions to the project was providing code for player movement and falling platforms,
                    animating the enemies, and testing the AR Image Tracking.</p>

Until it was revealed that they called for back up. After stealing her gym bag, they escaped into an unfinished painting. With no other choice, she followed them.</p>
                <p>This project was my first introduction to Unity and game development. Characters and animated
                    cutscene were made using Adobe Animate. Other visual assets were made with
