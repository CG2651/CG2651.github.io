                <p>
                    I am an undergraduate student from Boise State University studying Games,
                    Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology. I specialize in Game Development, 3D Modeling, and Digital
                    Art.

                <h4>Galactic Pizza Party</h4>
                <p>Galactic Pizza Party is a Unity VR game, built for Quest 2, where you deliver pizzas to aliens by
                    swinging around the city. The video shows an older concept where the player originally deliver
                    packages. After some classmates played the game, they kept referencing Spider-Man and pizza so I
                    decided to change it to that. I will update the video soon.</p>
                <p>Alien model was made using Adobe Photoshop and Autodesk Maya.</p>
